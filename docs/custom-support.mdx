# Support & Advanced

## Requesting support

We have done our best to make this API straightforward to use and have provided detailed documentation for each feature. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at jack@jackcrane.rocks

## Requesting advanced access

If you are feeling limited by the API, you can request access to the advanced endpoint, allowing you to run your own MongoDB `find` queries against the database.

Fill out this [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegU972xtt4XlsWJW0pqVJaN6BZTaTKEYJENStM3wH0wcA40Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) to request access.

### Terms & Conditions

By requesting access and subsequently using the advanced endpoints, you agree to the following terms and conditions:

- You will not use the advanced endpoints for any illegal or malicious purposes.
- You must make every reasonable attempt to keep your API key private. If we find the API key online, we will revoke access and contact you with a new one.
- You may not wrap the endpoint and provide open access to a third party without adding anything to the data. This means you can create apps with the data, but if you provide an API, you must maniplate the data before sending it on.
- Apps created with the API can be only used for apps related to FIRST Robotics.
- We reserve the right to revert access to the API at any time.
- We are not liable for any lost business, technical damage, or anything else relating to API outages, data failures, incorrect data, and revoked API keys.
