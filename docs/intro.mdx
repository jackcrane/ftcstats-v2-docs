# Introduction

Howdy ðŸ¤ ! Welcome to the documentation for the FTCStats API version 2! This is an **unofficial** API to provide data from the excellent website FTCStats.org. All data is owned by them.

## Why?

Why would you write an api for an already existing and freely availible data source?

- The data on FTCStats' website is great for viewing, but is very hard when it comes to more in-depth statistical analysis and for use in web applications.
- FTCStats' website is slow (due to the massive amount of content displayed). We can leverage modern technology and methodoligies to make the data more accessible.

## Getting Started

Because the FTCStats API is 100% free and open, we do not require an API key to access the data. We do ask you fill out this form to let us know how you are using the API.

## Technical recommendations and requirements

The FTCStats API is built as a RESTful API, meaning its resources are organized into endpoints and returns JSON data.
