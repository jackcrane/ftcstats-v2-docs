# Selecting data by OPR

## What _is_ an OPR?

:::tip

### TL;DR

OPRs are really complicated and hard to calculate. In the most simple of terms, it is an estimation of a team's individual contribution to the matches in which they competed. **For those of us who don't quite understand the stats, the higher the better.**
:::

Bear with us, OPRs are very mathy.

> OPR is now the more widely used term for what Karthik from Team 1114 once called "calculated contribution" â€” OPR attempts to calculate a team's contribution to their alliance's final score. If there were no alliances in FRC, a team's calculated contribution would simply be their average match score. This is an easy and straightforward metric to calculate. However, using average score with alliances, while giving you a positive predictor, isn't the most useful since the average score is a combination of the performance of all three teams on the alliance. 1114 starting using OPR in 2004 because they wanted a more useful metric to evaluate how teams had been playing than average score. They wanted a way to figure out, on average, what each team was contributing to their alliance's score. Here, OPR makes a key assumption: an alliance's final score is a linear combination of each alliance member's individual contribution. In other words, adding together the points earned by each member on a 3-team alliance results in the alliance's final score.

### Types of OPRs

In addition to the simple average OPR, FTCStats also provides us OPRs for each phase of play, as well as a penalty-free OPR.

The non penalty, Auto, Teleop, and End Game OPR's are more specifically called OPRc's, which are similar to OPR but we are instead minimizing the Ax-b linear equation rather than solving for Ax=b in order to apply constraints such as ensuring scores >= 0 and imposing upper bounds on game-specific performance.

## API Requests

Requests regarding OPRs are made using GET requests to the following endpoint:

```
https://ftcstats.jackcrane.rocks/api/performance/:type
```

The `type` parameter is required and can be one of the following:

- `opr`
- `normalized`
- `non_penalty`
- `auto`
- `teleop`
- `end_game`

The request should include an object in which you specify the values and logical operators you want to filter by:

```json
{
  "operator": ">",
  "value": 0.5
}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Field | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `operator` | `string` | The logical operator to use when comparing the value to the field. Refer to the following table for availible operators |
| `value` | `number` | The value to compare the field to. |

#### Operators

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Operator | MongoDB relation | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `>` | `$gt` | Greater than |
| `>=` | `$gte` | Greater than or equal to |
| `<` | `$lt` | Less than |
| `<=` | `$lte` | Less than or equal to |
| `==` | `$eq` | Equal to |
| `!=` | `$ne` | Not equal to |

The API will return a JSON document with an array of [PerformanceEntity](../performance-entity) objects:

```json
{
  "count": 5,
  "entities": {
    [
      PerformanceEntity,
      PerformanceEntity,
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```
